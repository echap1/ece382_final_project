# ECE382 Final Project
by Ethan Chapman

# Project Layout
## `msp432P401r_api/`
Crate generated by `svd2rust` to allow memory safe peripheral access.

## `trajectory_generator/`
Python package used to generate trajectories that the robot can follow. Not used for level 1 or level 2 but it does 
work. Also contains the code used to generate the level 1 coordinate graph.

## `main/`
Probably what you are looking for. Contains the code to initialize each of the peripherals I use and my level 1 and 2 logic.
